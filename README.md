# LeetCode-Solution

My LeetCode solution written with C# and Java.

The solution of different series is in the different folders:
* `Official/`: The official problem database's Java solutions (mainly for Daily Challenge).
* `Sword2Offer/`: The series of Sword2Offer by C# solutions.
* `TencentTop50/`: The series of Tencent Top 50 Problems by Java solutions.

When using the IDEA, should mark the folder `LeetCode-Solution` as the Sources Root.
